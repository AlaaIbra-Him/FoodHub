1. Purpose of a Git repository:
Stores project code history, enables version control, collaboration, and rollback for front-end projects.


2. Tracked vs untracked files:

Tracked: monitored by Git (committed or staged).

Untracked: new/ignored files not monitored.

Issues: untracked files may cause missing dependencies or inconsistent project builds.



3. Ignoring files (e.g., node_modules):
Prevents large, unnecessary, or machine-specific files from bloating the repo and causing conflicts.


4. Viewing project history:
Helps track changes, debug issues, revert mistakes, and understand how a webpage evolved.


5. Role of GitHub + GitHub Pages:
GitHub hosts code remotely for collaboration, backup, and sharing. GitHub Pages makes the project live via a URL, adding easy testing and showcasing value for developers.
